### Important! Dev setup instructions and sample workflow have moved to the project wiki

Monies suck is a web application that allows users to track their spending and income manually, without needing to connect to a financial institution. It replaces spreadsheets and non-intuitive means of budgeting. Users will be able to add and categorize expenses, add recurring incomes and expenses, see visual charts about their spending habits and plan for the future. Monies suck will help users to project out into the future what their savings might be and should allow users to play around with their spending habits and see what the future of their budgeting holds after tweaking spending in different categories.

Right now users can add expense types, add transactions, see the current month's spending totals in each category, and see a radial pie chart that visualizes monthly spending.
